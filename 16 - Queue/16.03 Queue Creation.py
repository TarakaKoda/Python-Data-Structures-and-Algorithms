    QUEUE CREATION:
    There are various ways of implementing Queue in python.

    Now let see 3 cases:
    1. using a python list without limit
    2. using a python list with limit
    3. using a python linked list

    Difference between LIST vs LINKED LIST as QUEUE

    Queue using List
    - easy to implement
    - with size limit list are more efficient comparing to list with without limit
    - speed problem when it grows in the case of list without limit

    Queue using Linked List
    - fast performance
    - implementation is that hard

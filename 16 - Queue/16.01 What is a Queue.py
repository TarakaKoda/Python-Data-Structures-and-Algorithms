    What is a queue?
    Queue is a Data Structure that stores items in a FIRST IN FIRST OUT manner.

    - Creating Stacks using Python lists and linked lists
    - Operations(enqueue,dequeue,peek,isEmpty,isFull)

    Why do We need it?
    We need a Stack Data Structure when we need to utilize the first coming data first

    Visual representation of stack:

    1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5 <- 6

    FIRST IN FIRST OUT : Here 1 is inserted first and 6 is inserted last

    [1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5 <- 6]

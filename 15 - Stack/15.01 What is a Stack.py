    What is a stack?
    Stack is a Data Structure that stores items in a LAST IN FIRST OUT manner.

    - Creating Stacks using Python lists and linked lists
    - Operations(push,pop,peek,isEmpty,isFull)

    Why do We need it?
    We need a Stack Data Structure when we need to utilize the last coming data first

    Visual representation of stack:

    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

    LAST IN FIRST OUT : Here 1 is inserted first and 6 is inserted last

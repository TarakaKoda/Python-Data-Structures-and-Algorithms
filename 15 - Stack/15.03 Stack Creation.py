class Stack:
    '''
    STACK CREATION:
    There are various ways of implementing Stack in python.

    Now let see 3 cases:
    1. using a python list without limit
    2. using a python list with limit
    3. using a python linked list

    Difference between LIST vs LINKED LIST as STACK

    Stack using List
    - easy to implement
    - speed problem when it grows

    Stack using Linked List
    - fast performance
    - implementation is that hard

class AVL_Tree:
    '''
    why do we need AVL tree?
    - If there are more numbers greater than root the  tree height becomes very long and searching and other operations
      are performed lower than expected so to overcome this difficulty AVL comes into picture.

    - AVL trees are essential because they provide a balanced tree structure, improved time complexity, guaranteed
      worst-case performance, and a versatile data structure for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
      They are an effective solution when maintaining a balanced binary search tree is necessary for optimal performance
      in a wide range of applications.

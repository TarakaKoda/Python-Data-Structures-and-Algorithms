      Recursive VS Iterative Method
      space efficient?  No              Yes            (No stack memory is required in case of iteration)
      Time efficient?   No              Yes            (In case if recursion system needs more time for pop and push elements to stack memory which makes recursion less time efficient)
      Easy to code?     Yes             No             (We use recursion especially in the cases we know that a problem can be divided into similar sub problems)

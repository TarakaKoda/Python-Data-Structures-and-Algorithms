    Why recursion?
      1. Recursive thinking is really important in programming, and it helps you break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use
      When to choose recursion
      - If you can divine the problem into similar sub problems
      - Design an algorithm to compute nth...
      - write code to list the n....
      - Implement a method ti compute all
      - proactive
      2. The prominent usage of recursion in data structures like trees and graphs
      3. It is used in many algorithms(DAC,Greedy and DP)

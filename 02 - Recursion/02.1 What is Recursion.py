    What is recursion?
      It is a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.
      Properties of recursion:
      - Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
      - In every strip we try smaller inputs to male the problem smaller
      - Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.

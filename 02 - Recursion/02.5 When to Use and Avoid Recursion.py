class recursion:
    '''
    when to use it?
        - when we can easily break down a problem into similar sub-problems.
        - when we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.
        - when we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one
        - when traverse a tee
        - when we use memoization in recursion
        When we can avoid recursion?
        - If time and space complexity matters for us
        - Recursion uses more memory. If we use embedded memory. For example an application that takes more memory in the phone is not efficient.
        - Recursion can be slow

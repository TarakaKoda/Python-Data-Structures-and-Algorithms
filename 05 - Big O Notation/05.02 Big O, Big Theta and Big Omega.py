    Notations:
      Big O : It is a complexity that is going to be less or equal to the worst case.
      Big-Omega : It is a complexity that is going to be at least more than the best case.
      Big Theta: It is a complexity that is within the bounds of the worst case and the best case.
      Big O - O(N)
      Big Omega : Omega(1)
      Big Theta : Theta(n/2)

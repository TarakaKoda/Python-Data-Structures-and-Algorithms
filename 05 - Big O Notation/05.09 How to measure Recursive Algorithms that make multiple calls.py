To measure the performance of recursive algorithms that make multiple calls, you can use various techniques. Here are a
few commonly used methods:

    1. Empirical analysis: This approach involves running the recursive algorithm with different input sizes and
       measuring the execution time. You can use a timer to record the elapsed time and then analyze the data to observe
       how the execution time increases with larger inputs. This method provides practical insights into the
       algorithm's performance but does not provide a formal time complexity analysis.

    2. Mathematical analysis: If the recursive algorithm follows a well-defined recurrence relation, you can analyze
       its time complexity mathematically. As mentioned in the previous answer, you need to determine the recurrence
       relation and solve it to obtain a mathematical expression. You can then use techniques such as substitution,
       recursion trees, or the master theorem to determine the time complexity.

    3. Asymptotic analysis: Asymptotic analysis focuses on determining the growth rate of the algorithm's time
       complexity as the input size approaches infinity. If your recursive algorithm makes multiple calls, you can use
       the master theorem or recurrence solving techniques to determine the asymptotic time complexity. Typically,
       the dominant term in the expression obtained from the analysis represents the time complexity.

    4. Benchmarking: Benchmarking involves comparing the performance of different algorithms or implementations to
       evaluate their relative efficiency. You can implement alternative versions of the recursive algorithm, optimize
       certain aspects, or even compare it to non-recursive solutions. By measuring and comparing the execution times,
       you can gain insights into the efficiency of the recursive algorithm in comparison to other options.

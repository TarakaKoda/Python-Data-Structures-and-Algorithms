     Searching algorithms are an essential topic in computer science and software development. Here's a brief overview
     of some commonly used searching algorithms:

    Linear Search: In a linear search, each element in a list or array is checked sequentially until a match is found or
                   the entire list is traversed.

    Binary Search: Binary search is a more efficient algorithm for searching sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the
                   search space in half until the target element is found.

    Hashing: Hashing is a technique that uses a hash function to map data to a fixed-size array called a hash table. It
             provides constant-time average case search complexity.

    Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch
                              before backtracking. It can be used for searching in graph-based data structures.

    Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in
                                breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex.

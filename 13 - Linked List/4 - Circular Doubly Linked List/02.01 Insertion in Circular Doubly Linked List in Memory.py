    Insertion in Circular Doubly Linked List
    - Inserting into a Circular Doubly Linked List is same as the Doubly Linked List but we need to change the references
      previous and next.
    - We can insert into Circular Doubly Linked List in 3 ways:
      - At the beginning of the circular singly linked list Time - O(1) space - O(1)
      - After a node in the middle of circular singly linked list Time - O(n) space - O(1)
      - At the end of the circular singly linked list Time - O(1) space - O(1)

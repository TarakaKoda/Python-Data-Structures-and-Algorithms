    Insertion in Doubly Linked List
    - Inserting into a Doubly Linked List is same as the Singly Linked List but we need to change the references
      previous and next.
    - We can insert into Doubly Linked List in 3 ways:
      - At the beginning of the Doubly linked list Time - O(1) space - O(1)
      - After a node in the middle of Doubly linked list Time - O(n) space - O(1)
      - At the end of the circular Doubly linked list Time - O(1) space - O(1)

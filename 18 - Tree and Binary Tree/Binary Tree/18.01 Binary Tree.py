      Binary Tree
      - Binary trees are the data structures in which each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left and right children
      - Binary is a family data structure(BST,Head tree,AVL,red black tree,Syntax tree)

      Why binary tree?
      - Binary trees are a prerequisite for more advanced trees like BST, AVL, Red Black Trees
      - Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problem can be solved efficiently using binary trees

class Binary_Tree:
    '''
    Binary Tree Operations:
    1. Creation of Tree

    2. Insertion of a node

    3. Deletion of node

    4. searching for a value
       DFS and BFS are the Algorithms used for Searching
       - Depth First Search (DFS)
         - PreOrder Traversal Binary Tree
         - InOrder Traversal Binary Tree
         - PostOrder Traversal Binary Tree
       - Breath First Search (BFS)
         - LevelOrder Traversal Binary Tree

    5. Traverse all nodes
         - PreOrder Traversal Binary Tree
         - InOrder Traversal Binary Tree
         - PostOrder Traversal Binary Tree
         - LevelOrder Traversal Binary Tree

    6. Deletion of Tree
